## Pre-requisites

### Python

- Python 3.10 or higher that PyTorch supports (3.11 is used for testing and development, probably the best option if you do not have any other Python versions installed)
- Installed from official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (not from Microsoft Store)
- Added to PATH (done by checking the "Add python.exe to PATH" box during installation) automatically or [manually](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/)

::: tip
You can check if you have Python correctly on path by opening CMD/PowerShell and typing `python --version`. If you get an error, you will need to add Python to path. Also make sure that you have the correct version of Python installed.

::: warning
If you installed Python from the Microsoft Store, you will need to uninstall it and install it from the official website.
